# The Censor's Redaction Desk — 1919

## Historical Context

In 1919, the British Raj passed the Rowlatt Acts — wartime emergency powers made permanent, allowing arrest without trial and press censorship without appeal. The Indian press, which had been growing bolder since the Swadeshi movement, faced an existential choice: comply and survive, or resist and risk confiscation.

Then came Jallianwala Bagh. On April 13, 1919, General Dyer ordered troops to fire on an unarmed crowd in Amritsar, killing hundreds. The colonial government immediately moved to control the narrative — imposing martial law, censoring telegraph lines, and threatening any editor who published the truth.

This game puts you in the chair of a real historical figure: the nationalist newspaper editor who must decide, word by word, how much truth the page can bear.

## You Play As

The **editor of a nationalist newspaper** — a composite inspired by real editors like Kalinath Ray of *The Tribune*, B.G. Horniman of the *Bombay Chronicle*, and the editors of *Amrita Bazar Patrika*. Your paper is based in Lahore, at the epicenter of the Rowlatt crisis.

## The Goal

Publish nine dispatches covering the major events of 1919 without losing your press (too much risk) or your readers (too much self-censorship). Survive the year with your credibility and your printing press intact.

## Core Mechanic: Interactive Redaction

Each dispatch arrives as a raw news story with highlighted phrases — words and sentences that the British censor would flag as seditious. You **click to redact** individual phrases before hitting "Print."

The mechanic is tactile and immediate: you are physically blacking out the truth with your own hand. Every redaction is a small betrayal of your mission. Every phrase you leave in is a small act of defiance.

### The Two Meters

- **Truth (starts at 100, blue):** Your credibility with readers. Every redaction costs Truth. Redact too aggressively and your paper becomes useless — just another government mouthpiece. The public stops reading.
- **Risk (starts at 0, red):** Your exposure to British reprisal. Every inflammatory phrase you publish adds Risk. Let it spike too high and the magistrate issues a confiscation order. Your press is seized. Game over.

### What Counts as Seditious

The game teaches the specific vocabulary of colonial censorship. Words flagged as dangerous include:
- **"Martyr" (Shaheed)** — validates the nationalist cause
- **"Atrocity"** — accuses the government of criminal violence
- **"Defenseless"** — contradicts the official "threatening mob" narrative
- **"Dyerarchy"** — a pun on Dyarchy (the reform system) and General Dyer
- **"Gagged"** — implies the government suppresses truth

Students learn that censorship isn't just about banning newspapers — it's about which *words* are allowed to exist in public.

## The Nine Dispatches

Each dispatch covers a real event from 1919, presented in chronological order:

1. Rowlatt Bills pass over Indian objection
2. Hartal (general strike) called by Gandhi
3. Arrests of local leaders in Punjab
4. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre
5. Martial law declared in Amritsar
6. Rabindranath Tagore renounces his knighthood
7. The Hunter Commission investigation
8. Gandhi suspends non-cooperation after Chauri Chaura
9. Year-end editorial: looking back

The difficulty escalates. Early dispatches have clear choices; by mid-game, almost every phrase is dangerous, and the redaction decisions become agonizing.

## Outcome Stamps

After each dispatch, you receive a verdict:
- **APPROVED** (green stamp) — you threaded the needle
- **CAUTION** (gold stamp) — the censor noticed but let it pass
- **WARNING** (red stamp) — you're on thin ice

At the end, a summary table shows your full record across all nine dispatches.

## What Students Learn

- **The mechanics of press censorship:** Not abstract "suppression" but the specific legal tools (Indian Press Act 1910, Rowlatt Acts, martial law regulations) and how they worked in practice
- **The editor's dilemma:** Every word is a calculated risk. Truth has a cost. Silence has a cost. There is no safe choice.
- **The power of language:** Why specific words ("martyr," "atrocity," "defenseless") were dangerous to colonial authority — and why the government feared them more than guns
- **Individual courage:** Real editors lost their presses, went to jail, were deported. The game makes that stakes tangible.

## Design Aesthetic

A walnut desk workspace — dark wood grain background, aged newsprint paper sheets, Courier Prime typewriter font. The visual language says: you are at a desk, alone, with a pen and a deadline. The stamps (APPROVED, WARNING) slam onto the page with a physical animation. Redacted phrases appear as solid black bars — the visual evidence of your self-censorship accumulating across the page.
