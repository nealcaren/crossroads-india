# The Salt March: Logistics of Nonviolence, 1930

## Historical Context

On March 12, 1930, Mohandas Gandhi and 78 hand-picked volunteers left the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad and began walking to the coastal village of Dandi, 240 miles away. Their stated goal was absurdly modest: to pick up a handful of salt from the sea, breaking the British salt tax monopoly. Their actual goal was to demonstrate that mass civil disobedience could be organized with military precision — and to make the entire world watch.

The march lasted 24 days. By the time Gandhi reached Dandi on April 5, thousands had joined. The global press was covering every step. Within weeks, salt laws were being broken across India, 60,000 people were arrested, and the British were facing the most organized challenge to their authority since 1857.

The standard narrative frames the Salt March as a spiritual act — Gandhi the saint, walking in sandals, leading by moral example. This game reframes it as what it actually was: a **logistics operation** of extraordinary sophistication, planned for months, with supply chains, media strategy, advance teams, and contingency plans. Non-violence wasn't passive. It was harder than war.

## You Play As

A **senior organizer in Gandhi's inner circle** — a composite inspired by real figures like Mahadev Desai (Gandhi's secretary), Abbas Tyabji (who took over after Gandhi's arrest), and Sarojini Naidu. You don't make Gandhi's strategic decisions; you make them *work*.

## The Goal

Guide the march from Sabarmati to Dandi (240 miles, 24 days) and arrive with maximum followers, maximum press coverage, and minimum casualties. "Winning" isn't binary — it's a question of *how well* you execute.

## Core Mechanic: Oregon Trail Lite

The game is structured as a **linear journey through a series of village stops.** At each stop, you make logistical allocation decisions — not political speeches but operational choices about resources, timing, and priorities.

This is the key distinction from the other games in the series: you're not choosing *what to believe* or *what to say*. You're choosing *how to move people through space and time*. The politics are already decided. The question is execution.

### Resources to Manage

- **Water & Supplies:** Gujarat in March is hot. Do you prioritize speed (shorter rest stops, push through midday) or hydration (longer breaks, slower pace)? Dehydration means stragglers, heatstroke, and bad optics. But arriving late means the press moves on to other stories.

- **Volunteers:** At each village, local Congress workers offer to help. Do you send them **ahead** to the next village to prepare roads, food, and lodging (speed boost, but the marchers feel isolated)? Or keep them **close** to sing bhajans and maintain group morale (slower, but the column holds together)?

- **Press Management:** The march's power was in its visibility. Foreign correspondents — especially Webb Miller of United Press — are trying to keep up, but they have their own schedules. Do you **wait** for them to arrive before entering a village (delay, but guaranteed international coverage)? Or **push on** and hope they file from secondhand accounts?

- **Discipline:** The British are trying to provoke violence. Agents provocateurs mix with the crowd. Village hotheads want to burn salt depots, not just collect salt. Do you spend time on **discipline drills** (slower march, but fewer incidents)? Or trust the training and **keep moving**?

### The Dashboard

A map of Gujarat shows the route with village nodes. The current position moves along the path. Flanking the map:

- **Followers:** How many people are marching with you (starts at 78, should grow)
- **Morale:** The collective spirit of the column
- **Global Awareness:** International press coverage
- **Days Remaining:** Time pressure — Dandi must be reached on schedule

## Key Decision Points

Each village stop presents 2–3 choices. Some are logistical; others are responses to events:

- **Day 3, Aslali:** The first village crowds are enormous. Do you stop for a full public meeting (morale + followers, but you lose half a day)?
- **Day 8, Anand:** A local mill owner offers trucks to carry supplies ahead. Accept (efficiency) or refuse (the whole point is *walking*)?
- **Day 12, Broach:** District magistrate issues an order forbidding village headmen from hosting the marchers. Camp in fields (hardship but defiance) or negotiate quietly (comfort but appearing to comply)?
- **Day 16, Surat:** Webb Miller's telegram says he'll arrive in two days. Wait for him or press on?
- **Day 20, Navsari:** Word arrives that the government may arrest Gandhi before Dandi. Do you accelerate the march (exhaustion risk) or maintain pace (arrest risk)?
- **Day 24, Dandi:** The final morning. How do you stage the salt-gathering for maximum visual impact?

## Scoring

The game doesn't have a binary win/lose. Instead, you receive an **outcome report** measuring:

- **Followers at Dandi** — did thousands join or did the column thin?
- **Global Awareness** — did the world press cover it or miss it?
- **Morale** — did the marchers arrive inspired or exhausted?
- **Incidents** — were there any outbreaks of violence that the British could use to discredit the movement?

A historical comparison shows how the real march performed on these dimensions — and what the organizers actually chose at each decision point.

## What Students Learn

- **Gandhi the strategist, not the saint:** The Salt March required months of planning, route surveys, advance teams, press invitations, and supply logistics. Nonviolence is not spontaneous moral purity — it's organized, disciplined, and tactical.
- **Logistics as politics:** Every operational choice (where to stop, who to invite, whether to wait for the press) had political consequences. The march was a media event as much as a protest.
- **The role of support networks:** Gandhi didn't walk alone. Thousands of village-level Congress workers made it possible. The game foregrounds this invisible labor.
- **Nonviolent discipline:** The hardest part of nonviolence isn't enduring violence — it's preventing your own side from retaliating. The game makes this tension concrete.

## Design Aesthetic

Earthy and sunlit — saffron, khadi white, dusty ochre, dried-earth brown. The visual language should feel like Gujarat in March: hot, bright, open. A map dominates the screen. Typography is clean and functional (no imperial grandeur here — this is a people's movement). The mood is purposeful and forward-moving, in contrast to the enclosed, bureaucratic feel of the colonial games.
