# Two Flags: The Muslim League, 1937–1946

## Historical Context

In 1937, the Muslim League was humiliated. In provincial elections held under the Government of India Act — the most democratic elections in Indian history to that point — the League won only 109 out of 482 reserved Muslim seats. In the crucial United Provinces, it won 27 out of 64. The Indian National Congress, running on a secular nationalist platform, swept almost everything else and formed governments in seven of eleven provinces.

The League was an elite club. It had Jinnah, a few nawabs, and no mass base. Congress had the machinery, the workers, the villages. Most Indian Muslims didn't care about the League, and the League didn't know how to talk to most Indian Muslims.

Nine years later, in the 1946 elections, the Muslim League won **every single reserved Muslim seat** in the Central Assembly and 439 out of 494 Muslim seats in the provinces. It was the most total political transformation in modern South Asian history. Within a year, Pakistan existed.

How did that happen?

This game is about the answer. It's not a story of inevitable partition. It's a story of **political organizing** — of finding the right message, at the right time, for the right audience — and of the path dependencies that turned demands for autonomy into demands for a separate nation.

## You Play As

A **Muslim League organizer in the United Provinces** (modern Uttar Pradesh) — the province where the League's failure was most painful and where its reconstruction mattered most. You're not Jinnah. You're the person who has to make Jinnah's vision work on the ground: recruiting local leaders, building district committees, choosing which mosques to visit and which landlords to court, and crafting the message that will turn "the Muslim League" from a name most Muslims have never heard into the vehicle for their political aspirations.

Your character is a composite drawn from real League organizers — educated, urban, politically sophisticated, but initially disconnected from the rural Muslim masses who will decide everything.

## The Goal

Build the Muslim League from a defeated elite club into a mass movement capable of winning the 1946 elections. Your success is measured not just in seats won but in the *kind* of movement you've built — because the coalition you assemble and the promises you make will determine what "Pakistan" means.

## Core Mechanic: Rhetoric and Coalition

This is a game about **words and commitments.** The central action is not allocating resources or managing logistics — it's **choosing how to frame your political message** and living with the consequences.

### How It Works

Each chapter presents a political moment — a crisis, an opportunity, a gathering. You must **draft your position** by choosing from competing framings of the League's demands. Each framing appeals to certain constituencies and alienates others. And once you've said something publicly, it becomes part of your **platform** — a cumulative record of commitments that constrains your future choices.

**Example:** At the 1940 Lahore session, you must articulate what "Muslim political power" means. Your options might include:

- **"Safeguards within a united India"** — appeals to moderate professionals and Congress-sympathetic Muslims, but doesn't excite the masses or distinguish you from Congress
- **"Strong provinces, weak center"** — appeals to landlords and provincial elites who want autonomy, but is vague enough that everyone hears what they want
- **"A sovereign Muslim homeland"** — electrifies students and the urban middle class, gets press attention, but commits you to a maximalist position you may not be able to deliver
- **"Islam in danger"** — the religious appeal. Brings in the ulema and the rural masses, but alienates secular Muslims and confirms Congress's accusation that the League is communalist

You can't choose all of them. You can't choose none. And whatever you choose, you'll have to live with it in the next chapter.

### The Platform

Your accumulated positions form a visible **platform document** that grows across the game. Early chapters give you flexibility — you can be vague, speak differently to different audiences, keep options open. But as your platform fills in, contradictions become harder to sustain. If you promised landlords you'd protect their estates AND told peasants you'd fight for land reform, someone is going to notice.

The platform creates **path dependency.** By the time you reach 1946, your coalition has its own logic, its own expectations, and its own momentum. You may find yourself committed to positions you didn't fully intend — which is exactly what happened historically.

### Constituencies

The Muslim electorate isn't monolithic. You're trying to assemble a coalition from groups with competing interests:

- **Landlords & Nawabs** — want property protection, provincial autonomy, continuation of their social status. They have money and local influence. They don't want radical change.
- **Urban professionals** — lawyers, doctors, civil servants. Want political representation, government jobs, educational opportunity. Jinnah's natural base. Skeptical of religious appeals.
- **Ulema (religious scholars)** — split. Some (Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind) support Congress and oppose the League. Others see the League as Islam's political vehicle. Winning them over requires religious credibility.
- **Students** — idealistic, impatient, drawn to bold slogans. Easy to mobilize, hard to control. They want revolution, not committee meetings.
- **Rural masses** — the largest group by far, and the most disconnected from elite politics. They care about rent, debt, and the local landlord. They respond to religious identity but not to constitutional abstractions. Reaching them requires networks you don't have yet.
- **Provincial politicians** — local leaders with their own bases who might affiliate with the League if the price is right. They bring followers but demand autonomy and patronage.

Each constituency has a **support level (0–100)** that shifts based on your messaging choices. Your total coalition strength — the sum of these supports, weighted by constituency size — determines your electoral performance.

## Chapter Structure

Six chapters, each built around a historical turning point:

### Chapter 1: The Wreckage (1937–1938)
The elections are over and the results are devastating. Congress has formed governments and — critically — refused coalition with the League in UP, despite the League's offer. You must decide how to interpret the defeat: Was the message wrong? The organization? Or the audience?

**Key choice:** How do you frame the Congress's refusal to share power? As a negotiating tactic (keep the door open) or as proof that Congress will never treat Muslims as equals (burn the bridge)?

### Chapter 2: The "Muslim Mass Contact" Crisis (1938–1939)
Congress launches a campaign to recruit Muslims directly, bypassing the League entirely. Nehru says the League doesn't represent ordinary Muslims. He's not entirely wrong — yet. This is an existential threat.

**Key choice:** Do you counter with your own mass contact program (expensive, slow, but builds real organization)? Or do you focus on elite alliances with provincial leaders who bring instant followers?

### Chapter 3: War and Opportunity (1939–1940)
World War II breaks out. Congress demands a promise of independence in exchange for war support; the British refuse; Congress ministries resign in protest. The League declares a "Day of Deliverance." And then comes Lahore, March 1940 — the resolution demanding "independent states" for Muslim-majority regions.

**Key choice:** The Lahore Resolution is deliberately vague — "states" plural, not "a state." How do you sell it? As a negotiating position (maximum leverage, minimum commitment)? Or as a sacred promise (maximum mobilization, locked-in destination)?

### Chapter 4: Quit India (1942–1943)
Congress launches Quit India in August 1942. Gandhi, Nehru, and the entire Congress leadership are arrested within hours. The movement is crushed within weeks — but Congress leaders remain in prison until 1945. For three years, the political field belongs to the League.

**Key choice:** This is the strategic windfall. Do you use the Congress vacuum to quietly build organization in the provinces (slow, sustainable)? Do you collaborate with the British war effort to bank favors (effective, but "collaborator" stigma)? Or do you go on an aggressive recruitment drive, claiming the Congress has abandoned Muslims (fast growth, but built on a negative message)?

### Chapter 5: The Simla Conference (1945)
The war is ending. Congress leaders are released. Lord Wavell convenes a conference to discuss India's constitutional future. The League demands **parity** with Congress — equal representation despite being smaller. Congress says this is absurd. The conference collapses.

**Key choice:** Simla's failure can be framed as Congress intransigence or as British failure. More importantly: after eight years of organizing, your coalition has internal tensions. Landlords want the League to cut a deal that protects their property. Students want Pakistan now. The ulema want Islamic governance. You've promised different things to different people. What do you emphasize going into the election?

### Chapter 6: The Election (1946)
The final test. Provincial elections that will determine whether the League can claim to speak for Indian Muslims — and therefore whether Pakistan is a viable demand. Your platform, your coalition, your accumulated commitments all converge on this moment.

**Outcome:** Your electoral results are calculated from your constituency support levels. The historical League won almost every Muslim seat. Can you match that? And if you do — what have you promised to get there?

## The Ending

The game doesn't end with partition. It ends with the election results and a **reflection screen** that shows:

- Your platform — every commitment you made, laid out in sequence
- Your coalition — who supports you and why
- The contradictions — promises that can't all be kept
- A historical epilogue noting what actually happened next: the Cabinet Mission, Direct Action Day, partition, and the question of what "Pakistan" was supposed to be

The point isn't that partition was right or wrong. The point is that it was **constructed** — assembled from specific choices, messages, and alliances by specific people in specific circumstances. Students should leave understanding that the outcome wasn't foreordained.

## What Students Learn

- **Why the League succeeded:** Not because of ancient Hindu-Muslim animosity but because of concrete political organizing, message discipline, and exploitation of political opportunities — the same skills that explain any mass movement's rise
- **The Muslim political perspective:** Students playing the other games see Muslims as a background group. This game centers their agency, their internal debates, and their genuine dilemmas
- **How coalitions work:** Building a big-tent movement means making contradictory promises. The game makes this dynamic visceral — you can see your own platform becoming incoherent
- **Path dependency in politics:** Early messaging choices constrain later options. The demand for Pakistan started as a bargaining chip and became an irreversible commitment. The game shows *how* that happens
- **Partition wasn't inevitable:** In 1937, the League was irrelevant. Something had to change to make Pakistan possible. Understanding *what* changed is the entire point

## How This Differs from the Salt March

Both games are about building movements, but the mechanics are completely different:

| | Salt March | Two Flags |
|---|---|---|
| **Core action** | Allocate physical resources | Choose political rhetoric |
| **Movement type** | Linear journey through space | Coalition building across constituencies |
| **Timeframe** | 24 days | 9 years |
| **Challenge** | Logistics under physical constraint | Messaging under political constraint |
| **Failure mode** | Exhaustion, straggling, violence | Coalition fracture, contradictory promises |
| **Tone** | Purposeful, sunlit, forward march | Strategic, tense, increasingly high-stakes |
| **What's at stake** | A demonstration | A nation |

The Salt March is about *executing* a plan. Two Flags is about *discovering what you stand for* — and finding that the answer keeps shifting under your feet.

## Design Aesthetic

Teal and marble — cool, deliberate, modern. The League was an urban movement led by lawyers and professionals. The visual language should feel like a political campaign headquarters: clean surfaces, typed documents, newspaper clippings pinned to a board. The platform document grows visibly on one side of the screen. Constituency support bars update after each choice. The color palette (deep teal, slate, cream, with green accents) is distinct from the warm earth tones of the Salt March and the jeweled darkness of the Maharaja. The mood is cerebral and strategic, not spiritual or martial.
