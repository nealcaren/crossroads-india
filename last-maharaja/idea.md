# The Last Maharaja: Survival 1790–1857

## Historical Context

The Mughal Empire has collapsed into a patchwork of successor states. The East India Company, originally a trading concern, has become the subcontinent's dominant military power — not through a single conquest but through a slow, methodical system of treaties, loans, and annexations that turned sovereign rulers into pensioned dependents. Between 1790 and 1857, hundreds of princely states lost their independence. Most didn't fall to armies. They fell to paperwork.

This game covers the long decline: from the subsidiary alliance system under Wellesley, through the cultural interventions of the Anglicists, to the Doctrine of Lapse under Dalhousie, and finally to the explosive rupture of 1857.

## You Play As

The **Maharaja (or Nawab) of a fictional Indian princely state** — a composite drawn from real kingdoms like Mysore, Awadh, Hyderabad, Jhansi, and Satara. You inherit the throne at the start of the game and must hold it for 67 years of mounting pressure.

## The Goal

Survive until 1857 without any of your three core stats reaching zero. If you make it, the Great Rebellion reshuffles everything — but whether you join it or suppress it becomes your final, defining choice.

## Core Mechanic: The Iron Triangle

Three stats form an impossible balancing act:

- **Treasury (0–100):** Fiscal capacity to fund your state. The Company constantly finds ways to drain it — loans, tributes, "protection" fees. Once it's gone, you can't maintain your army or your court.
- **British Favor (0–100):** Your diplomatic standing with the Company. High favor buys you breathing room. Low favor makes you a target for annexation. But favor is earned by surrendering sovereignty.
- **People's Loyalty (0–100):** Your subjects' faith in your rule. Cultural concessions to the British, religious insensitivity, or economic hardship erode it. If it collapses, you face internal revolt — and the British will use that as a pretext to intervene.

The trap: almost every decision that raises one stat lowers another. Accept a subsidiary alliance and your Favor rises but your Treasury and Loyalty bleed. Resist British pressure and your Loyalty holds but Favor plummets. Spend on your people and your Treasury shrinks.

## Structure: Four Eras

The game moves through four historical phases, each with its own character:

### Era 1: The Military-Fiscal Trap (1790–1805)
The Company offers "protection" in exchange for tribute and a British Resident at your court. Tipu Sultan has just fallen. The Marathas are fracturing. You can ally with the Company early (safety now, dependence later) or try to stay independent (freedom now, vulnerability later).

**Anchor events:** Subsidiary Alliance offer (1798), Maratha War loans (1805)

### Era 2: The Crisis of Legitimacy (1806–1835)
The cultural front opens. Missionaries arrive. Macaulay's Minute pushes English education. Sati abolition and other social reforms are imposed or encouraged. These aren't just cultural — they're sovereignty questions. Who governs your people's customs?

**Anchor events:** Missionaries (1813), Macaulay's Minute (1835)

### Era 3: The Era of Annexation (1836–1852)
Dalhousie arrives and the rules change. The Doctrine of Lapse means any state without a direct male heir can be annexed. Adoption — the traditional solution — is no longer recognized. States start falling: Satara, Jhansi, Nagpur. The railway arrives, making British military deployment faster than ever.

**Anchor events:** Doctrine of Lapse (1848), The Iron Horse (1853)

### Era 4: The Final Years (1853–1857)
Oudh is annexed despite having an heir. The writing is on the wall. Sepoys are restless. The question is no longer whether crisis comes, but which side you'll be on when it does.

**Anchor events:** Oudh Warning (1856), The Great Rebellion (1857)

## The Advisor System

Events are presented by historical court figures, each with a distinct perspective:

- **Dewan** (vizier/finance minister) — pragmatic, fiscal focus
- **Senapati** (general) — military honor and strength
- **Raj Guru** (priest/spiritual advisor) — tradition and dharma
- **Seth** (merchant) — trade and economic survival
- **Gupta-char** (spy/intelligence) — information and leverage
- **British Resident** — the Company's voice inside your court

Each advisor frames the same situation differently. The Dewan sees a treaty as a fiscal question; the Raj Guru sees it as a question of dharma; the Resident presents it as inevitable progress.

## Replayability

The game uses a **dynamic deck system.** Eight anchor events always appear (they're historically essential), but 40–50 additional events are drawn randomly from a pool, 1–2 per era. No two playthroughs are identical.

## Win/Loss Conditions

- **Immediate defeat** if Treasury, British Favor, or Loyalty reaches 0
- **Survival victory** if you reach 1857 with all stats above zero
- **Final choice** in 1857: side with the British (survive but at what cost?) or join the Rebellion (freedom or destruction)

## What Students Learn

- **Why princely states declined:** Not through dramatic conquest but through a slow system of financial dependency, legal manipulation, and cultural pressure
- **The impossible position of indigenous rulers:** Every "choice" was constrained by structural power imbalances
- **Agency within constraint:** Even in a rigged system, decisions mattered — some states survived longer, some preserved more autonomy, some resisted more effectively
- **The long arc toward 1857:** The Rebellion didn't come from nowhere; it was the cumulative result of decades of grievance

## Design Aesthetic

Mughal court elegance — deep jewel tones (navy, purple, emerald), gold accents, Cinzel serif headers. Card-based layout with advisor badges. A timeline bar fills across the top as decades pass. The visual language says: this is a court, not a battlefield. The weapons here are treaties and ledgers.
