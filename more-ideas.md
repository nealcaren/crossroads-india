# The Pact: Gandhi vs. Ambedkar, 1932

## Historical Context

In 1932, the British Prime Minister announced the "Communal Award," granting the "Depressed Classes" (Dalits) separate electorates—meaning they would vote for their own representatives in separate constituencies, just like Muslims and Sikhs.

Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the Dalit leader, had fought for years for this. He believed it was the only way to secure political power for Untouchables.

Mohandas Gandhi, however, saw this as the "vivisection of Hinduism." He believed it would permanently sever the Untouchables from the Hindu fold. From his cell in Yerwada Jail, he declared a "fast unto death." He would starve until the separate electorates were revoked.

The country panicked. If Gandhi died, the backlash against Dalits would be apocalyptic. Ambedkar was trapped: surrender his people's political rights to save Gandhi, or hold his ground and risk a genocide.

## You Play As

**Tej Bahadur Sapru** (or a similar moderate mediator). You are the bridge between the starving Mahatma in Yerwada Jail and the stubborn, brilliant Doctor in Bombay. You are the only person both sides trust—barely.

## The Goal

Forge a compromise (The Poona Pact) that saves Gandhi’s life *and* secures enough seats for Dalits to satisfy Ambedkar. You are fighting against time.

## Core Mechanic: The Vitality Clock

This is a game of **negotiation under extreme time pressure.**

### The Clock

A **"Gandhi’s Vitality"** bar decreases every turn.

* **100–80:** Gandhi is writing letters. The press is calm.
* **79–50:** Gandhi stops taking liquids. Riots break out in orthodox Hindu areas. Pressure mounts on Ambedkar.
* **49–20:** Gandhi is failing. Medical bulletins are issued hourly. The Viceroy is preparing for martial law.
* **0:** Gandhi dies. Game Over (The "Catastrophe" Ending).

### The Negotiation Table

You must shuttle between two locations:

1. **Yerwada Jail (Gandhi):** He speaks in moral absolutes. He wants "Joint Electorates" (everyone votes together) but offers "Reserved Seats" (guaranteed Dalit winners) as a compromise.
2. **Bombay (Ambedkar):** He speaks in constitutional specifics. He wants "Double Votes" (Dalits vote twice) or a higher number of seats.

**Your Action Deck:**

* **Public Pressure:** Use the press to guilt Ambedkar ("The Mahatma is dying!"). *Effect:* Lowers Ambedkar's resistance but increases Dalit resentment (lowers future stability).
* **The Numbers Game:** Offer Ambedkar more reserved seats in the provincial legislatures. *Effect:* Ambedkar approves, but orthodox Hindus (Malaviya) threaten to reject the pact.
* **Moral Appeal:** Appeal to Gandhi's love for "Harijans." *Effect:* Gandhi may soften on the mechanism (e.g., the primary system).

### The Dilemma

Ambedkar knows Gandhi is using his life as a weapon. If you pressure Ambedkar too hard, he walks away ("I will not be bullied by a suicide threat"). If you don't pressure him enough, Gandhi dies.

## Outcome

The game ends when a Pact is signed or Gandhi dies. The **Epilogue** shows the long-term cost:

* **Historical Result:** The Poona Pact gave Dalits *more* seats than the British offered, but took away the separate electorate.
* **Reflection:** Did you save the man but lose the movement? Students playing Ambedkar in the main RTTP game will finally understand why he is so bitter toward the "Mahatma."

## Design Aesthetic

Stark and claustrophobic. The visual language of a jail cell and a lawyer's office. The ticking sound of a clock is constant. The screen edges vignette (darken) as Gandhi’s health fails.

# Chalo Delhi: The Tiger’s Army, 1943–1945

## Historical Context

While Congress launched "Quit India" and the League organized for Pakistan, a third force was trying to liberate India by force. Subhas Chandra Bose ("Netaji") fled house arrest, traveled to Berlin and Tokyo, and took command of the **Indian National Army (INA)**—a force of 40,000 Indian POWs captured by Japan.

Bose’s slogan was "Give me blood, and I will give you freedom." His strategy was to march from Burma into India, expecting the Indian British Army to defect and the civilians to rise up. It was a desperate gamble that relied on Japanese logistics, which were collapsing.

## You Play As

**Captain Lakshmi Sahgal** (commander of the all-female Rani of Jhansi Regiment) or **Gen. Shah Nawaz Khan**. You are managing the INA's advance through the jungles of Burma and Imphal.

## The Goal

Reach Indian soil and plant the Tricolor at Moirang. Keep your army intact against British artillery, monsoon rains, and—most dangerously—Japanese betrayal.

## Core Mechanic: Loyalty vs. Supply

This is a **resource management survival game** where your two main resources move in opposite directions.

### The Resources

1. **Revolutionary Fervor (Morale):** Starts high. Fueled by Bose’s speeches, radio broadcasts, and victories.
2. **Logistics (Supply):** Starts low. Dependent on the Japanese Imperial Army.

### The Campaign Map

You move your regiment through nodes (Rangoon, Mandalay, Imphal, Kohima). At each node, you face a **Tactical Choice**:

* **The Japanese Request:** The Japanese commander demands your troops carry their supplies or dig their bunkers.
* *Refuse:* Maintain dignity and Fervor, but lose Supply (starvation sets in).
* *Accept:* Get rice and ammo, but Fervor drops (troops feel like Japanese mercenaries, not freedom fighters).


* **The British Propaganda:** The British drop leaflets promising full pardon and hot food to defectors.
* *Ignore:* Risk desertion.
* *Counter-Propaganda:* Spend Fervor to hold the line.


* **The Monsoon:** The rains begin. Sickness spikes. Do you halt (lose momentum) or march (lose men)?

### The "Radio Azad Hind" Feature

Between turns, you must choose a broadcast theme for Bose to deliver from Singapore.

* *"The British are fleeing!"* (Boosts Fervor, but lowers credibility if you are actually losing).
* *"Starvation is the price of liberty!"* (Mitigates Fervor loss from low supplies).

## The Defeat

Historically, the INA was defeated militarily at Imphal. But the game teaches the **"Winner's Curse."** Even if you lose every battle on the map, if you maintain high **Fervor**, the *trial* of your officers (The Red Fort Trials) becomes the spark that destroys British legitimacy in 1946.

**Victory Condition:** You don't have to take Delhi militarily. You have to scare the British enough that they realize they can no longer trust the Indian Army.

## Design Aesthetic

Jungle green and mud brown. The visuals are gritty and exhausted—rain-streaked maps, rusted rifles. The audio landscape is crucial: Bose’s electrifying speeches crackling over static-filled radio, contrasted with the sound of torrential rain.

# The Lotus and the Chapati: Network of Mutiny, 1857

## Historical Context

Before the 1857 Mutiny exploded, something strange happened. Thousands of chapatis (unleavened bread) were passed from village to village across North India. A watchman would bake four, send them to the next village, and tell them to do the same. No one knew exactly what they meant, but everyone felt something was coming.

Simultaneously, rumors raced through the Sepoy cantonments: *The cartridges are greased with cow and pig fat. The flour is mixed with bone dust. The Russians are coming.*

This game fills the gap of **how the rebellion organized** without a central leader or mass media. It explores the "Sociology of Rumor."

## You Play As

A **Sepoy Conspirator** in the Bengal Army. You are moving between cantonments (Barrackpore, Meerut, Delhi, Lucknow), trying to synchronize the uprising.

## The Goal

Ignite the Mutiny in at least 5 major cantonments simultaneously. If you trigger it too early in one place (like Mangal Pandey did), the British will disarm the other regiments. If you wait too long, the plot is discovered.

## Core Mechanic: The Infection Map

The map shows British cantonments connected by roads and telegraph lines.

### Action: Sowing Rumors

You have a limited number of **"Rumor Tokens"** (Greased Cartridges, Bone Dust Flour, Forced Conversion). You place these in specific regiments.

* *Greased Cartridges:* highly effective on High Caste Hindus and Muslims; low effect on Sikhs.
* *Bone Dust:* Effective on the peasantry/villages.

### The "Telegraph" Threat

The British have a unique advantage: **The Telegraph.** If a mutiny starts in Meerut, the British player (AI) sends a telegram to Lahore. The Lahore regiments are disarmed immediately.

* **Your Counter-Move:** You must physically cut the wires or bribe the telegraph operators *before* the shooting starts.

### The "Chapati" Network

You can activate the Chapati chain. It moves slowly but raises the "General Unrest" level of the countryside, making it harder for British troops to move between cities.

### The Trigger

You decide when to give the signal.

* *Too Early:* Only Meerut rises. The rest are crushed.
* *Perfect Timing:* Meerut, Delhi, and Lucknow rise on the same Sunday while officers are at church. The Telegraph lines are dead. The Raj collapses.

## What Students Learn

* **Network Theory:** How information spreads in a pre-digital age.
* **The Fragility of the Raj:** The British were outnumbered 4,000 to 1. They ruled only because the Sepoys allowed them to.
* **Why it Failed:** The lack of central coordination. The game is *hard* to win because coordinating a simultaneous uprising without radio/phones is a logistical nightmare.

## Design Aesthetic

Sepia and red. The map looks like an old East India Company survey. The connections between cities look like nerve endings. When a cantonment mutinies, it burns on the map. The "Telegraph" is represented by a sharp, mechanical clicking sound that signifies your plan is being exposed.
