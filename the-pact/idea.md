# The Pact: Gandhi vs. Ambedkar, 1932

## Historical Context

In August 1932, British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald announced the Communal Award — a plan for India's new constitutional structure that granted separate electorates to the "Depressed Classes" (Dalits). Under this system, Dalits would vote in their own constituencies for their own representatives, just as Muslims and Sikhs already did. For the first time, Untouchables would have guaranteed, independent political power.

Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had fought for years for exactly this. Born into the Mahar caste, he had endured a lifetime of humiliation — forbidden from drinking at public wells, barred from Hindu temples, forced to sit outside the classroom at school. He had earned doctorates from Columbia and the London School of Economics, passed the bar in London, and returned to India determined to dismantle the caste system through constitutional politics. The separate electorate was his instrument: political power that didn't depend on Hindu goodwill.

Mohandas Gandhi saw it differently. From his cell in Yerwada Jail in Pune, where he was imprisoned for civil disobedience, Gandhi declared the Communal Award a British strategy to "vivisect" Hinduism — to permanently sever Untouchables from the Hindu community by giving them a separate political identity. On September 20, 1932, he began a fast unto death. He would not eat until the separate electorate was revoked.

The fast was a political earthquake. Gandhi was the most revered figure in India. If he died, the backlash against Dalits — whom many orthodox Hindus already blamed for the crisis — could be catastrophic. Temples that had never admitted Untouchables suddenly opened their doors. Wells were "purified." Upper-caste Hindus wept in the streets. The message was clear, even if unspoken: *give up the electorate, or the Mahatma's blood is on your hands.*

Ambedkar was trapped. He believed — correctly, as history would show — that without a separate electorate, Dalit representatives would be chosen by Hindu-majority electorates and would owe their seats to caste Hindu voters, not to the Dalit community. They would be tokens, not advocates. But if Gandhi died, Dalits would face a pogrom. The man fighting for Dalit liberation was being asked to surrender his most powerful weapon to save the life of the man taking it away.

The negotiations lasted five days. On September 24, the Poona Pact was signed. Ambedkar gave up separate electorates. In exchange, he received reserved seats — more seats than the British had offered, but in joint electorates where all Hindus voted together. Gandhi broke his fast. India celebrated.

Ambedkar never forgave him. He later called it "a pistol held at my head."

## You Play As

**Tej Bahadur Sapru** — or a composite mediator modeled on him. Sapru was a Kashmiri Brahmin, a distinguished lawyer, a moderate liberal, and one of the few people both Gandhi and Ambedkar would speak to. He was neither a Congress hardliner nor a caste radical. He believed in constitutional politics, negotiated compromise, and the possibility that reasonable men could find common ground.

He was also a man with no leverage. Gandhi held his own life as a weapon. Ambedkar held the moral high ground of the oppressed. The British held the original Award and could reimpose it at any time. Sapru had nothing but his relationships, his reputation, and his ability to find language that both sides could accept.

You are the person in the room with no power and all the responsibility.

## The Goal

Forge a compromise — the Poona Pact — that saves Gandhi's life and secures enough political representation for Dalits to satisfy Ambedkar. Fail, and either Gandhi dies (catastrophe) or Ambedkar walks away (deadlock, and Gandhi dies anyway).

## Core Mechanic: The Vitality Clock

This is a **negotiation game under extreme time pressure.** Unlike every other game in the series, the clock is always running. There is no safe pace. There are no turns you can afford to waste.

### Gandhi's Vitality (0–100)

A prominent bar at the top of the screen tracks Gandhi's physical condition. It decreases every turn, and the rate of decrease accelerates as his body weakens.

- **100–80:** Gandhi is alert, writing letters, issuing statements. The press covers the fast but the mood is still political, not panicked. You have room to negotiate.
- **79–50:** Gandhi stops taking water. His blood pressure drops. Medical bulletins go out hourly. Riots begin in some cities — not against the British, but against Dalits. Upper-caste mobs "cleanse" neighborhoods. The pressure on Ambedkar becomes unbearable.
- **49–20:** Gandhi is failing. He can no longer write. Visitors are restricted. The Viceroy prepares contingency plans for martial law. Nehru, Patel, and Rajagopalachari send increasingly desperate telegrams to Ambedkar. The entire Congress machinery turns on one man.
- **Below 20:** Critical. Every turn could be the last. If Vitality reaches 0, Gandhi dies. Game over — the "Catastrophe" ending.

The Vitality clock means you cannot play for time. Every turn spent building rapport, exploring options, or gathering information is a turn Gandhi gets weaker. The game punishes perfectionists and rewards decisive (if imperfect) action.

### The Two Rooms

The game alternates between two locations, two men, and two completely different languages of politics:

#### Yerwada Jail — Gandhi

Gandhi speaks in moral absolutes. He frames the issue as a question of Hindu unity and spiritual integrity. He is warm, charming, and immovable. His position:

- **Non-negotiable:** Joint electorates. All Hindus vote together. No separate Dalit constituency.
- **Flexible:** The number of reserved seats. The mechanism for ensuring Dalit candidates get nominated (a primary system, for instance). The duration of reservations.
- **His weapon:** His own death. He doesn't threaten — he simply states that he will not eat. The threat is implicit in every word he speaks, in every medical bulletin posted outside the jail.

When you visit Gandhi, you're negotiating with a man who has already decided he's willing to die. You can shift him on details, but not on principle.

#### Bombay — Ambedkar

Ambedkar speaks in constitutional specifics. He frames the issue as a question of political power and structural justice. He is brilliant, angry, and exhausted by a lifetime of being told to wait. His position:

- **Non-negotiable:** Meaningful political representation that doesn't depend on Hindu goodwill. Dalits must have enough seats, and enough electoral independence, to actually advocate for their community.
- **Flexible:** The mechanism. He prefers separate electorates but will consider alternatives — a primary system where Dalits choose candidates who then face the general electorate, a higher number of reserved seats, or time-limited provisions with sunset clauses.
- **His weapon:** The moral clarity of the oppressed. Every time you pressure him, he can point to three thousand years of caste oppression and ask why *he* is the one who must compromise.

When you visit Ambedkar, you're negotiating with a man who knows that anything he gives up, his people will never get back.

### Your Action Deck

Each turn, you choose one action. Some are available at both locations; others are location-specific.

**Shuttling:**
- **Visit Gandhi** — Hear his current position, probe for flexibility, report on Ambedkar's stance. Each visit costs a turn (Vitality drops).
- **Visit Ambedkar** — Hear his current position, present Gandhi's latest offer, gauge his breaking point. Each visit costs a turn.

**Pressure Tactics:**
- **Invoke the Press** — Leak information to journalists. You can frame the story to pressure either side. Leaking Gandhi's deteriorating health pressures Ambedkar ("The Mahatma is dying because of you"). Leaking Ambedkar's flexibility pressures Gandhi ("Ambedkar is ready to deal — meet him halfway"). *Risk:* If the leak backfires or is seen as manipulative, trust with that party drops.
- **Mobilize Allies** — Ask Congress leaders (Rajagopalachari, Patel, M.C. Rajah) to intervene with one side. *Effect:* Can shift a position marginally, but each ally has their own agenda and may push in unexpected directions.
- **Present a Proposal** — Put a specific compromise on the table: a number of seats, a mechanism, a duration. *Effect:* Both sides react. If the numbers are close to acceptable, negotiations advance. If they're insulting to either side, trust drops.

**Conciliation:**
- **Temple Gesture** — Organize a high-profile temple opening for Dalits. *Effect:* Raises the public mood, slightly slows Gandhi's Vitality decline (hope), but Ambedkar may see it as performative — "They open the temple door when he's dying, and they'll close it again when he eats."
- **Private Conversation** — Spend a turn in genuine, off-the-record dialogue with one party. No proposals, no pressure — just listening. *Effect:* Builds trust slowly. Trust makes future proposals more likely to succeed.

### Hidden Stats

Behind the scenes, the game tracks:

- **Gandhi's Trust in You (0–100):** If it drops too low, he refuses to see you. You lose your channel.
- **Ambedkar's Trust in You (0–100):** If it drops too low, he walks out. Negotiations collapse.
- **Ambedkar's Resistance (0–100):** How firmly he's holding to his maximalist position. Starts high. Pressure lowers it, but too much pressure and trust collapses instead.
- **Public Mood:** The national emotional temperature. High public panic makes Ambedkar's position harder to sustain but also makes any eventual pact feel coerced rather than genuine.

### The Proposal System

At any point, you can draft a **formal proposal.** A proposal has three components:

1. **Number of reserved seats** — Ambedkar wants more. Gandhi wants fewer. The historical Poona Pact landed on 148 (up from the British offer of 71, but in joint electorates).
2. **Electoral mechanism** — Joint electorate with reserved seats (Gandhi's minimum), a primary system where Dalits pick nominees (Ambedkar's compromise), or some hybrid.
3. **Duration** — Temporary (10 years, revisable) or permanent (constitutional guarantee). Gandhi prefers temporary. Ambedkar insists on permanence.

Both sides evaluate your proposal against their current positions, modified by trust and pressure. If both accept, the Pact is signed. If one rejects, you lose a turn and Vitality drops further.

## The Five Days

The game unfolds across five in-game days (September 20–24, 1932), with 2–3 action turns per day. That gives you roughly 10–15 total actions before the clock runs out.

### Day 1: September 20
Gandhi begins his fast. The mood is tense but not yet panicked. You have the most freedom here — use it to establish relationships, understand positions, and identify the zone of possible agreement.

### Day 2: September 21
The first medical bulletin is alarming. Congress leaders begin flooding Bombay to pressure Ambedkar. M.C. Rajah (a Dalit Congress loyalist) offers to sign on Ambedkar's behalf — a move that would undercut Ambedkar's authority entirely. Do you encourage this (faster resolution, but Ambedkar is sidelined) or shut it down (slower, but the pact has real Dalit consent)?

### Day 3: September 22
Gandhi's condition worsens. Reports of anti-Dalit violence arrive from multiple cities. Ambedkar is furious — "This is exactly what I predicted." The emotional temperature of every conversation changes. Reasoned argument becomes harder. Desperation creeps in.

### Day 4: September 23
The crisis point. If no framework is in place by end of day, the window closes. Madan Mohan Malaviya (orthodox Hindu leader) inserts himself into negotiations, pushing for minimal Dalit representation. You may need to manage three parties, not two. Gandhi is barely conscious.

### Day 5: September 24
Final hours. Whatever imperfect agreement you can assemble must be signed today. There is no more time for elegant solutions. The question becomes: what can you get Ambedkar to accept before Gandhi dies?

## Endings

### The Pact (Historical Outcome)
Both sides sign. Gandhi breaks his fast. India celebrates. The epilogue reveals the long-term cost: Dalit politicians in joint electorates became dependent on caste Hindu votes, exactly as Ambedkar feared. Decades later, he called the Pact the "greatest mistake of my life." Reserved seats without a separate electorate produced representation without power.

### The Walkout
Ambedkar refuses to sign. Trust collapsed, or the terms were too insulting. Gandhi dies within days. The epilogue describes the backlash: anti-Dalit violence across India, the British reimposing the Communal Award anyway (but now tainted by Gandhi's death), and Ambedkar, vindicated in principle but destroyed in practice, unable to build the political movement he envisioned.

### The Capitulation
You pressured Ambedkar too hard. He signs, but with minimal concessions — fewer seats, weaker mechanisms, a sunset clause. Gandhi lives. The epilogue shows that Dalit representation was even more hollow than in the historical outcome. Ambedkar's bitterness becomes permanent alienation.

### The Breakthrough (Ahistorical)
Through exceptional trust-building and creative proposal design, you forge a pact that genuinely satisfies both sides — perhaps a robust primary system with a high number of permanent seats. Gandhi lives. Ambedkar is cautiously optimistic. The epilogue notes that this outcome didn't happen in history, and asks: *why not? What would have had to be different — not just in this room, but in this country?*

## What Students Learn

- **Moral coercion as political strategy:** Gandhi's fast was not a passive act of conscience — it was a weapon, arguably the most powerful in his arsenal. The game makes students feel its force and its injustice simultaneously. They should leave uncomfortable with both men and sympathetic to both.

- **The Dalit political perspective:** Most narratives of Indian independence center Congress and the League. Dalits appear as objects of reform, not agents of politics. This game puts Ambedkar's constitutional vision at the center and forces students to engage with his arguments on their merits — not as a footnote to Gandhi's sainthood.

- **Negotiation under constraint:** The game teaches that compromise isn't about finding the "right answer" — it's about finding *any* answer before the clock runs out. Students learn that time pressure, asymmetric power, and emotional manipulation shape outcomes as much as the merits of arguments.

- **The cost of compromise:** The Poona Pact is often taught as a happy ending — Gandhi lives, Dalits get seats, unity is preserved. The game reveals it as a tragedy: a community surrendered independent political power under duress, and the consequences lasted for generations.

- **Why Ambedkar matters:** Students who have played The Last Maharaja (princely resistance), Divide & Rule (colonial administration), and Two Flags (Muslim politics) will arrive at The Pact understanding multiple perspectives on Indian independence. Ambedkar adds the one they're most likely missing: that independence from Britain was necessary but not sufficient, because the deeper unfreedom — caste — was internal.

## How This Differs from Every Other Game

| | The Pact | Other Games |
|---|---|---|
| **Timeframe** | 5 days | Weeks to decades |
| **Core pressure** | A man is dying | Stats might hit zero |
| **Player role** | Mediator with no power | Decision-maker with authority |
| **Mechanic** | Shuttle negotiation | Choices, redaction, logistics, rhetoric |
| **Emotional register** | Claustrophobic, urgent, morally agonizing | Strategic, atmospheric, exploratory |
| **Failure** | Someone dies or walks out | You lose your position |

The compression is the key. Every other game gives you room to recover from mistakes, to adjust course, to play the long game. The Pact doesn't. You have fifteen actions and a dying man. That's a fundamentally different experience.

## Design Aesthetic

Stark and claustrophobic. Two dominant spaces: the whitewashed walls and iron bars of Yerwada Jail, and the dark wood and leather of a Bombay law office. The palette is severe — charcoal, ash white, deep red (the Vitality bar), and black. No gold, no jewel tones, no warmth. This is not a court or a desk or a march route. This is a room where a man is dying and another man is being told it's his fault.

The Vitality bar dominates the top of the screen, impossible to ignore. It should feel like a hospital monitor — clinical, relentless, indifferent to your negotiations. The screen edges vignette (darken) as Gandhi weakens. Typography is sharp and modern — this is a constitutional crisis, not a period drama.

When you switch between Yerwada and Bombay, the entire visual environment changes — light and spare in the jail, dark and heavy in the law office. The contrast reinforces that these two men inhabit different worlds, and you are the only person who moves between them.
